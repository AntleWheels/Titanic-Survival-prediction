ðŸš¢ Predicting Titanic Survival Using Machine Learning ðŸŽ¯

I recently completed a project on predicting Titanic survival using Python and machine learning!
This project was a deep dive into: âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
âœ… Feature Engineering
âœ… Model Building with Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:

Cleaned and visualized the Titanic dataset.
Built a predictive model using GaussianNB, leveraging its efficiency for probabilistic classification.
Achieved an accuracy of 78% and identified key factors influencing survival.
Discovered intriguing patterns in survival rates!


This project enhanced my skills in data analysis and predictive modeling. I'd love to hear your thoughts or feedback! ðŸ™Œ
